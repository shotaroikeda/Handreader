#Handreader
A project that detects handwritten numbers from training data.

Training Data are all 28x28 ASCII files. Read more about it in training/readme.txt

Based off of Naive-Bayes and Maximum-Likelihood.

#Requirements
Requires 2 python packages:
	1. matplotlib
	2. numpy

#Running Code
Just run main.py to obtain what numbers were wrong in the test data. More advanced stuff requires the interactive python module, or creating another python script to handle the data.

The functions required are commented as Training+Postprocessing.
